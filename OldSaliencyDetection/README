+ RELATIONAL ENTROPY-BASED SALIENCY DETECTION IN VIDEOS
+ K. Duncan, S. Sarkar
+
+ This code performs the video saliency detection routine outlined
+ in the 2012 IEEE Conference on Image Processing Paper entitled:
+ "Relational Entropy-based Saliency Detection in Images and Videos"
+

	THE CODE WRITTEN HERE IS JUST A RAPID PROTOTYPE THAT CONTAINS
	BUGS, SEEN AND UNSEEN. PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Building:
	- Assumes a Linux-based / Mac OS. Would not work on Windows as is
	STEPS:
	o Run setupJPEG in the image directory first to build the jpeg 
	  libraries required by the RImage class. You MUST adjust the
	  $IMAGE variable so that it reflects the absolute path of the
	  image directory on your system.
	  
	o Run make all...and that should be it
	
Using:
	./ComputeVideoSaliency sequences/example 001 200 25
		o 'sequences/example' is the path to the directory containing
		  the extracted frames from the target video. The frames must
		  be *.pgm format to work and the files should be named as
		  frame_0001.pgm, frame_0002.pgm etc. (I know this is really
		  specific and stupid but this is just the way it was 
		  implemented in a hurry.)
		  
		o '001' - the frame to start processing from
		
		o '200' - the frame to stop at for processing
		
		o '25' - the pixel sampling percentage (would then be 25/100)
		
	Also, it is important to note that all output goes to the 'results' 
	folder in order for the composite saliency maps to be placed. 
	Again, this is really specific and stupid, but that is how it 
	was implemented at the time.
	
	An example sequence entitled 'surfing' can be found in the 
	sequences directory.
